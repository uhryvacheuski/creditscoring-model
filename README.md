# creditscoring-model
Application of different classification algorithms to model credit score

Data soruce: https://www.kaggle.com/brycecf/give-me-some-credit-dataset

Metric: ROC-AUC
Metrics best value: 0.755349

Due to imbalanced data applied undersampling with helps to increase metric value

Tried to apply below algorithms
- Logistic Regression
- KNN
- SVM
- Decision Tree (best)
- Random Forest 
- Gradient Boosting
